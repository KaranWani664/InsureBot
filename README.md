## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, or deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

### 1\. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
  * **Maven**
  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended) & **npm**
  * **Docker Desktop** (for local containerization and `docker-compose`)
  * **kubectl** (Kubernetes command-line tool, for deploying to K8s)
  * A **Kubernetes Cluster** (e.g., Minikube for local testing, or a cloud provider's managed Kubernetes service like OKE, EKS, GKE, AKS)
  * **Oracle Database** server running and accessible (either locally, in a separate Docker container, or in a cloud instance).

### 2\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurebot-quest-2025.git
cd insurebot-quest-2025
```

### 3\. Dockerize Applications

First, build the Docker images for both your backend and frontend.

1.  **Build Backend Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    mvn clean package spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=your-dockerhub-username/insurebot-backend:latest
    # Or, if using a Dockerfile directly:
    # docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/insurebot-backend:latest .
    cd ..
    ```
2.  **Build Frontend Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/insurebot-frontend:latest .
    cd ..
    ```
3.  **Push Images to a Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GCR, ECR):**
    *(Required for Kubernetes deployment to pull images)*
    ```bash
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/insurebot-backend:latest
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/insurebot-frontend:latest
    ```
    (Replace `your-dockerhub-username` with your actual Docker Hub username or registry path.)

### 4\. Local Development with Docker Compose (Optional, for quick local setup)

This method is ideal for quick local testing without a full Kubernetes cluster.

1.  **Configure Database and API Keys:**
      * Open `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` and ensure your Oracle database connection details (URL, username, password) are set up.
      * Add your Google Cloud API key (`google.cloud.api.key=your_google_cloud_api_key`).
2.  **Configure Frontend API URL:**
      * Create or update `frontend/.env` with `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api`.
3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will start the backend, frontend, and potentially a local Oracle DB (if configured in `docker-compose.yml`). The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or as configured in `docker-compose.yml`).

### 5\. Deployment to Kubernetes

This method is for deploying your application to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, GKE, OKE).

1.  **Configure Kubernetes Manifests:**

      * Navigate to the `kubernetes/` directory.
      * **Edit `backend-deployment.yaml` and `frontend-deployment.yaml`:** Update `image` fields to point to your pushed Docker images (e.g., `your-dockerhub-username/insurebot-backend:latest`).
      * **Configure Oracle Database Connection (Kubernetes Secrets/ConfigMaps):**
          * **Highly Recommended:** Store sensitive database credentials (username, password) as Kubernetes Secrets.
          * Update `backend-deployment.yaml` to reference these secrets as environment variables.
          * Example Secret creation (replace with your values):
            ```bash
            kubectl create secret generic oracle-credentials \
              --from-literal=username=your_oracle_user \
              --from-literal=password=your_oracle_password \
              --from-literal=url='jdbc:oracle:thin:@//your.oracle.host:1521/YOUR_SERVICE_NAME'
            ```
            Then, reference these in `backend-deployment.yaml`:
            ```yaml
            env:
              - name: SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: oracle-credentials
                    key: username
              - name: SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: oracle-credentials
                    key: password
              - name: SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: oracle-credentials
                    key: url
            ```
      * **Configure Google Cloud API Key (Kubernetes Secret/ConfigMap):** Similarly, store your `google.cloud.api.key` as a secret or ConfigMap and inject it into the backend deployment.
      * **Adjust Services/Ingress:** Review `backend-service.yaml`, `frontend-service.yaml`, and `ingress.yaml` to match your desired service exposure and external access rules (e.g., hostnames in `ingress.yaml`). If deploying Oracle within Kubernetes, set up `oracle-pv.yaml` and `oracle-pvc.yaml` and reference them in your Oracle deployment.

2.  **Deploy to Kubernetes:**

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
    ```

    This command will apply all `.yaml` files in the `kubernetes/` directory.

3.  **Verify Deployment:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get svc
    kubectl get ingress
    ```

    Monitor the pod status until all services are running.

4.  **Access the Application:**

      * If using an Ingress, access the application via the hostname configured in `ingress.yaml` (you might need to update your local `hosts` file or DNS).
      * If using a `NodePort` service (for simpler testing without Ingress), get the node IP and port:
        ```bash
        kubectl get svc frontend-service # Look for NodePort
        minikube ip # If using Minikube
        ```
        Then, navigate to `http://<Node-IP>:<NodePort>` in your browser.
