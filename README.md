# InsureBot Quest 2025: Intelligent Conversational Insurance Agent 🗣️💼

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the future of insurance\! Our project, developed for the **InsureBot Quest 2025 Hackathon**, aims to revolutionize customer engagement in the insurance sector. We've built an **Intelligent Conversational Insurance Agent** capable of understanding, speaking, and serving like a human insurance representative. This bot is designed to handle common insurance queries, provide personalized information, and significantly improve the user experience through natural, empathetic interactions.

Leveraging cutting-edge AI and natural language processing, powered by a robust **Java & Spring Boot** backend and an intuitive **React.js** frontend, our InsureBot is a step towards making insurance accessible, understandable, and customer-centric.

## ✨ Features

  * **Voice-Enabled Interaction:** Speak naturally with the bot as you would with a human agent.
  * **Intelligent Query Handling:** Accurately responds to a wide range of common insurance questions (e.g., policy details, claim status, premium inquiries).
  * **Human-like Conversation:** Designed to replicate real human conversation, including tone and natural flow.
  * **Contextual Understanding:** Maintains context throughout the conversation for a seamless experience.
  * **Personalized Responses:** Delivers relevant and tailored information based on user input and simulated data.
  * **Robust Interruption Handling:** Gracefully manages interruptions and deviations in conversation.
  * **Scalable Architecture:** Built with scalability in mind, ready to integrate with real-world insurance knowledge bases.

## 💡 Problem Solved

In the traditional insurance landscape, customers often face challenges with complex jargon, long wait times, and impersonal interactions. Our InsureBot addresses these pain points by:

  * **Providing Instant Support:** Users get immediate answers to their queries, reducing frustration and wait times.
  * **Simplifying Information:** Translates complex insurance terms into easily understandable language.
  * **Enhancing Accessibility:** Offers an intuitive voice interface, making insurance information readily available to a wider audience.
  * **Improving Customer Satisfaction:** Delivers a more engaging and personalized customer service experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1\. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
  * **Maven** (or Gradle)
  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended) & **npm** (or Yarn)
  * **SQL Database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or **MongoDB** server running

### 2\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurebot-quest-2025.git
cd insurebot-quest-2025
```

### 3\. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Configure Database:**
    Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update your database connection details (URL, username, password).
    *For MongoDB, ensure your MongoDB instance is running and configured.*
3.  **Set up API Keys (if applicable):**
    If you're using external APIs (e.g., for LLMs, STT/TTS), add your API keys to `application.properties` or as environment variables.
    ```properties
    # Example for Google Cloud APIs
    google.cloud.api.key=your_google_cloud_api_key
    # Or for OpenAI API
    openai.api.key=your_openai_api_key
    ```
4.  **Build the Spring Boot application:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    (or `gradle build` if using Gradle)
5.  **Run the Spring Boot application:**
    ```bash
    java -jar target/insurebot-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    (Adjust `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to your actual jar name)
    The backend should start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### 4\. Frontend Setup (React.js)

1.  **Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install`)
3.  **Configure API Base URL:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory if it doesn't exist, and add your backend API URL:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api # Or wherever your backend is running
    ```
4.  **Start the React development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (or `yarn start`)
    The frontend should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

Now you can interact with the InsureBot through the web interface\!
