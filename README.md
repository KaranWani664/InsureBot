# InsureBot Quest 2025: Intelligent Conversational Insurance Agent 🗣️💼

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the future of insurance! Developed for the **InsureBot Quest 2025 Hackathon**, our project revolutionizes customer engagement in the insurance sector. We've built an **Intelligent Conversational Insurance Agent** that understands, speaks, and serves just like a human insurance representative. This bot handles common insurance queries, provides personalized information, and significantly improves the user experience through natural, empathetic interactions.

Leveraging cutting-edge AI and natural language processing, powered by a robust **Java & Spring Boot** backend and an intuitive vanilla JavaScript frontend, our InsureBot makes insurance accessible, understandable, and customer-centric.

  * **Intelligent Query Handling:** Accurately responds to a wide range of common insurance questions, including policy details, claim status, and premium inquiries.
  * **Human-like Conversation:** Designed to replicate real human conversation, including tone and natural flow.
  * **Contextual Understanding:** Maintains context throughout the conversation for a seamless experience.
  * **Personalized Responses:** Delivers relevant and tailored information based on user input and simulated data.
  * **Robust Interruption Handling:** Gracefully manages interruptions and deviations in conversation.

Traditional insurance often presents customers with complex jargon, long wait times, and impersonal interactions. Our InsureBot directly addresses these pain points by:

  * **Providing Instant Support:** Users receive immediate answers to their queries, significantly reducing frustration and wait times.
  * **Simplifying Information:** Translates complex insurance terms into easily understandable language.
  * **Enhancing Accessibility:** Offers an intuitive voice interface, making insurance information readily available to a wider audience.
  * **Improving Customer Satisfaction:** Delivers a more engaging and personalized customer service experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend (Conversational Logic & API)

  * **Java:** Core programming language.
  * **Spring Boot:** Framework for building robust and scalable microservices.
  * **Spring Data JPA:** For seamless database interaction with a relational database.
  * **Core NLP/NLU Library/Framework:** **Google Gemini API** (via Spring AI or REST API calls) for advanced natural language understanding and generation, providing the core intelligence for conversational responses.
  * **Speech-to-Text (STT) Integration:** **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API** (via REST/Java SDK) for accurate transcription of user voice input.
  * **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration:** **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API** (via REST/Java SDK) for natural, human-like voice responses from the bot.

### Frontend (User Interface)

  * **HTML5:** Structures the web pages.
  * **CSS3:** Provides modern and attractive styling.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers client-side scripting.
  * **Bootstrap:** Ensures a responsive design framework.
  * **Web Speech API (Browser API):** Utilized for direct microphone access and basic browser-level speech recognition/synthesis fallback if external APIs are unavailable, or for real-time local processing.

### Database

  * **SQL Database: Oracle Database** – Chosen for its enterprise-grade capabilities, high performance, and robust security features, making it ideal for managing large volumes of critical insurance data.

### Other Tools & Libraries

  * **Maven:** Build automation tool for Java.
  * **npm:** Package manager for JavaScript.
  * **Git & GitHub:** For robust version control and collaborative development.
  * **Swagger/OpenAPI:** For API documentation and testing.
