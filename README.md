# InsureBot Quest 2025: Intelligent Conversational Insurance Agent 🗣️💼

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the future of insurance\! Our project, developed for the **InsureBot Quest 2025 Hackathon**, aims to revolutionize customer engagement in the insurance sector. We've built an **Intelligent Conversational Insurance Agent** capable of understanding, speaking, and serving like a human insurance representative. This bot is designed to handle common insurance queries, provide personalized information, and significantly improve the user experience through natural, empathetic interactions.

Leveraging cutting-edge AI and natural language processing, our InsureBot is a step towards making insurance accessible, understandable, and customer-centric.

## ✨ Features

  * **Voice-Enabled Interaction:** Speak naturally with the bot as you would with a human agent.
  * **Intelligent Query Handling:** Accurately responds to a wide range of common insurance questions (e.g., policy details, claim status, premium inquiries).
  * **Human-like Conversation:** Designed to replicate real human conversation, including tone and natural flow.
  * **Contextual Understanding:** Maintains context throughout the conversation for a seamless experience.
  * **Personalized Responses:** Delivers relevant and tailored information based on user input and simulated data.
  * **Robust Interruption Handling:** Gracefully manages interruptions and deviations in conversation.
  * **Scalable Architecture:** Built with scalability in mind, ready to integrate with real-world insurance knowledge bases.

## 💡 Problem Solved

In the traditional insurance landscape, customers often face challenges with complex jargon, long wait times, and impersonal interactions. Our InsureBot addresses these pain points by:

  * **Providing Instant Support:** Users get immediate answers to their queries, reducing frustration and wait times.
  * **Simplifying Information:** Translates complex insurance terms into easily understandable language.
  * **Enhancing Accessibility:** Offers an intuitive voice interface, making insurance information readily available to a wider audience.
  * **Improving Customer Satisfaction:** Delivers a more engaging and personalized customer service experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Core NLP/NLU Framework:** [e.g., Rasa, Google Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, Custom LLM integration with OpenAI/Anthropic/Hugging Face]
  * **Speech-to-Text (STT):** [e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Azure Cognitive Services Speech, AssemblyAI]
  * **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** [e.g., Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Azure Cognitive Services Speech]
  * **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries like `transformers`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn` if applicable)
  * **Database (for Knowledge Base):** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Pinecone (for vector embeddings)]
  * **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurebot-quest-2025.git
    cd insurebot-quest-2025
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up API Keys (if applicable):**
    If you're using external APIs (e.g., for LLMs, STT/TTS), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    GOOGLE_SPEECH_API_KEY=your_google_speech_key
    # ... other API keys
    ```

5.  **Train the model (if applicable):**
    If your bot requires training, run the training script:

    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```

6.  **Run the bot:**

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

    (Instructions for interacting with the bot will appear in the console, or it might launch a web interface/terminal prompt.)
